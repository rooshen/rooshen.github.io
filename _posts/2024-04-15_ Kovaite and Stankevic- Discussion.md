<H1> Discussion on Risks of Digitalisation of Business Models paper by Kovaite and Stankeviciene </H1>

<p>The authors of this paper have referenced a few articles and authors to describe the term industry 4.0 as a transformation of business models through technological drivers, such as Internet of Things, cloud technology, big data; artificial intelligence, and related issues (Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019). They also amalgamate their definition of industry 4.0 into the term Internationalisation which this paper's case study is about.
The main risk that is evident in the internationalisation of an SME is the availability of key resources. Key resources are those that will be able to run and maintain IT systems. This is a major issue at work as well. I work for a bank in South Africa and the availability of key resources for IT projects and Cyber positions are always required.
The other risk category that becomes apparent is that the SME gets introduced to internationalisation, which introduces the company to international cyber-attacks, due to a larger footprint than they would have had previously.
The Market research report (2021), on Industry 4.0 shows that the compounded growth expectation between 2022 to 2026 is 20.6% i.e. over 165 billion USD, which ties into the requirements for business model transformation as per Kovaite and Stankevičienė (2019). There are many driving factors for the growth in Industry 4.0 and one of them being the emergence of digital technology.  Industrial robot integration is a major issue for companies as it requires expertise for re-design and integration into 20-year-old technologies. In smaller SME’s the cost could be crippling, as per one of the Internal factors, financial capacity states in the 6-factor model referenced in Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019 paper.
As customers realise the benefits of industry 4.0 it will further push the growth and risks that are involved in emerging technologies and fast paced transformation.</p>
