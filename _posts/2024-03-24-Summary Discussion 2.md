<H1> Summary â€“ discussion 2 CVSS </H1>

 <p>In summation, I do agree with all the points addressed by  J.Spring. et al. 2021 article, but the alternative solutions mentioned are not as easily interrupted and may require further analysis such as SVSS.  Keeping the issues highlighted by J. Spring et al, 2021 and other version issues identified (Wikipedia, n.d), such as complexities of using libraries, web vulnerabilities and varied interruptions of score and limitations of scoring IOT, should be kept in mind when completing a risk assessment as this helps assess the residual risk and improve the compensating controls that can be implemented. As not all these issues may be relevant to the environment being assessed or the risk appetite may be lower for certain vulnerabilities identified. 

We should also consider that CVSS is a free open industry standard and use of this is completely voluntary (Wikipedia, n.d).   CVSS has had multiple version adjustments to improve and address concerns raised. It is currently in version 4 which was released in 2023 (Wikipedia, n.d). 

Not only is CVSS used by NIST and PCI DSS (J.Spring. Etl al 2021), it has also been adopted by The National vulnerability database, Open-Source Vulnerability database (OSVDB) and CERT co-ordination center (Wikipedia, n.d). 

Considering that one should not rely on a singular vulnerability score which does not consider the strategy, business requirements and risk appetite of the business being addressed, but rather use the expert advice and ongoing evaluation that CVSS provide to help evaluate and implement controls that your business and risk teams find acceptable. </p>
