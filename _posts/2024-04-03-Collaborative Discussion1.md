    <h1>Discussion 1 </h1>
    <p>The authors of this paper have referenced a few articles and authors to describe the term industry 4.0 as a transformation of business models through technological drivers, such as Internet of Things, cloud technology, big data; artificial intelligence, and related issues (Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019). They also amalgamate their definition of industry 4.0 into the term Internationalisation which this paper's case study is about. 

The main risk that is evident in the internationalisation of an SME is the availability of key resources. Key resources are those that will be able to run and maintain IT systems. This is a major issue at work as well. I work for a bank in South Africa and the availability of key resources for IT projects and Cyber positions are always required. 

The other risk category that becomes apparent is that the SME gets introduced to internationalisation, which introduces the company to international cyber-attacks, due to a larger footprint than they would have had previously. 

The Market research report (2021), on Industry 4.0 shows that the compounded growth expectation between 2022 to 2026 is 20.6% i.e. over 165 billion USD, which ties into the requirements for business model transformation as per Kovaite and Stankevičienė (2019). There are many driving factors for the growth in Industry 4.0 and one of them being the emergence of digital technology.  Industrial robot integration is a major issue for companies as it requires expertise for re-design and integration into 20-year-old technologies. In smaller SME’s the cost could be crippling, as per one of the Internal factors, financial capacity states in the 6-factor model referenced in Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019 paper. 

As customers realise the benefits of industry 4.0 it will further push the growth and risks that are involved in emerging technologies and fast paced transformation.

The term Industry 4.0 was popularized in 2016 by Klaus Schwab the chairman of the world economic forum (Wikipedia, 2013). We are also aware that anything new is always a target for hackers. We as risk practitioners also must be prepared for the unknown risk events that come with the adoption of the latest technologies, better known as Black swan events. A black swan event is best described as a low probability, high impact event that is difficult to predict. 

Industry 4.0 also brings changes such as globalization and internationalization as described by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019). This increase footprint from local to international markets makes the target scope much larger for hackers, which is also something risk practitioners must be prepared for. 

Each new technology introduced comes with its own new risks that we may not be aware of or the framework being used to identify risks were not built to identify the lower-level risks. This is where I think using industry approved and tested comes in handy. Which ones we use is another debate. 

Risk should not be a control (Risk Management is a Decision Enabler, Not a Control, n.d.)+ rather it should be a business enabler rather than business disablers.

<p> Peer response week 2 – Anja 

Hi Anja 

This was a very informative post. I agree with your conclusion that IT risks are a priority as well as environmental considerations. These considerations should be included within the frameworks and risk strategies. Unfortunately, Environmental, sustainable and governance (ESG) frameworks (Paul,L.G. 2023), do not incorporate IT risks, but some IT risks can be incorporate ESG enhancements. 

 Data security requirements and GDPR, require hard drives to be wiped or destroyed, once wiped it can be easily recycled. (Pure Planet. 2018). The main ingredient in touch screens is Indium and is in short supply (Akhavan, B. 2021), reuse of these screens might be a solution. Green computing is the use of non-toxic material in the development of computer parts making them more environmentally friendly (Wikipedia, 2005). 

We should also never overlook old risks and only concentrate on new emerging risks. A lot of times unsupported operating systems such as OS2008 server may still be in use but migrated as is to cloud because the application works. The risk is just transferred from one platform to another.

<H> Summary Post</H>
<p>Summary Post week 3

Industry 4.0 brings many new challenges and opportunities to industries and individuals alike. As per Kovaite and Stankevičienė (2019), Globalization opens literally a world of opportunity to the global markets and the number of new clients. This also comes at a cost as processes need to be in place to deliver, keep stock and ensure regulations are in place.  Businesses need to get their ducks in a row before considering globalization. They also must hire IT and cyber experts to run these systems and provide advice.
In terms of cyber risk threats and vulnerabilities it becomes evident that the correct threat assessment needs to be completed and this requires someone with a background in IT and cyber (Shevchenko, N. 2018). Globalization also brings in more income and regulatory requirements which may differ based on the country your clients are in eg GDPR, PCI DSS etc.  Mitigations of certain risks especially cyber risk will become necessary as with a global footprint comes a global threat.
It also becomes evident that staff are necessary when implementing Industry 4.0 technology, especially if processes change and security controls need to implemented, within these processes.
